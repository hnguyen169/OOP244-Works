//I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

At first glance, I thought workshop 1 was going to be a cakewalk but I came to realize the workshop was more than simply copying functions. Before doing anything to the source code I tested the program and confirmed it was working as intended. Afterwards, I start by creating appropriately named header and implementation files for the modules. Then I organized the source code into the modules and made sure to include correct compilation safeguards for each header to prevent multiple inclusions of the header file. The majority of workshop was spent following the workshop instructions and separating the source code into their respective modules. I emphasized paying attention to specifics such as global variables, structure definitions, and constant value declarations because these may change the location of where a variable or structure is supposed to be. For header files, I included declarations of any functions, variables, and structures and the rest of the code (function definitions) would go into the implementation files. Then I verified all of the #includes to avoid any unnecessary #includes or header files. Finally, I surrounded all of the code except for the module with the main function (shoppingListApp.cpp) in the seneca namespace and used it in shoppingListApp.cpp. Working on this workshop, I gained familiarity with C++ code, including some new additions not present in C, and learned about namespaces and how to implement them.
